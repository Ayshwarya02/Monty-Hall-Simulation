# Monty-Hall-Simulation

Monty hall problem comes from a famous movie where three doors are used to help you win a car. How? Each door hides something behind it–a car and two goats. Any door can have the car while the remaining two have goats. The probability to find a car is ⅓. Now, if you select Door 1 and the host opens Door 3 to find a goat, your chances just become ⅔. This program will help you solve this problem.
